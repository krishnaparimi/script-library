Accessing Variables from a Workflow (not available in sc_request table)
You can access variables from within the workflow using the following syntax:
current.variables.variable_name
So, to set the task's company field to the 'company' variable, do:
task.company = current.variables.company
within your task activity.

Likewise you can add a 'run script' activity to set the sc_req_item's company field
current.company = current.variables.companyÂ
